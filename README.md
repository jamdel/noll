This is a project written in [Processing](https://processing.org) that is meant to simulate Michael Noll pieces.

Right now it follows the same rules as [Gaussian Quadratic](http://dam.org/artists/phase-one/a-michael-noll/artworks).


You can find an example of it running [here](http://cgi-cmsc.cs.uchicago.edu/~jamdel/arth/noll2/noll2.html).
